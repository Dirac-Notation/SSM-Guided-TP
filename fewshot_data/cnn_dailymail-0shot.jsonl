The NFL legend called out Deion Sanders Jr. on Twitter for saying he only eats \"hood doughnuts.\" In response, the elder Sanders -- in front of his 912,000 followers -- reminded his son he has a trust fund, a condo and his own clothing line called \"Well Off.\" \"You're a Huxtable with a million $ trust fund. Stop the hood stuff!\" Sanders followed it up with another tweet that included the hashtags #versacesheets #Huxtable and #Trustfund.

In two years' time, the Scandinavian nation is slated to become the first in the world to phase out radio entirely. That doesn't mean that Norwegians will be left with radio silence; they'll merely have to tune in digitally. According to officials in Oslo, many in this nation of 5 million have already made the move. On FM, Norwegians can only find five stations. On the Digital Audio Broadcasting network, there are four times that number. Half the country already listens that way, said Culture Minister Thorhild Widvey. \"Listeners will have access to more diverse and pluralistic radio-content, and enjoy better sound quality and new functionality,\" Widvey said in a news release. Officials say the move will spur innovation because the cost of digital transmission will save some $25 million. But the country's radio waves won't cut out all once, a blog post on Radio.no explained. Radio will be phased out region by region, starting in January 2017 and concluding in December.\nQ: Summarize the above article briefly in 1 sentences.

The Oregon Parks and Recreation Department has reported that a section of a fiberglass boat 20 or 30 feet long was spotted off the state's coast this week and has been towed into harbor. The debris is suspected to be from the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan on March 11, 2011. The boat fragment was found this week and towed to Newport, Oregon, where it is moored at a marina. Inside were found -- more than four years and 4,000 miles later, if officials' suspicions are correct -- some specimens of a variety of yellowtail jack fish normally found in Japanese waters. Biologists with the Oregon Coast Aquarium and Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine Science Center inspected the debris while it was still at sea and determined that the ecological threat posed by invasive species was small. The remnants of the boat will be dried out, inspected further and taken to a landfill. But for the yellowtail jack fish, the journey is not over.

The group said it launched an assault on the Baiji oil refinery late Saturday. By Sunday, ISIS said its fighters were inside the refinery and controlled several buildings, but Iraqi government security officials denied that claim and insisted Iraqi forces remain in full control. CNN couldn't independently verify ISIS' claim. It wouldn't be the first time that militants and Iraqi forces have battled over the refinery, a key strategic resource that has long been a lucrative target because the facility refines much of the fuel used by Iraqis domestically. If an attack damaged oil fields or machinery, it could have a significant impact. The refinery is just 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the northern Iraqi city of Tikrit, which Iraqi forces and Shiite militias wrested from ISIS less than two weeks ago.

The country joined several of its South American neighbors in allowing the unions when President Michelle Bachelet enacted a new law on Monday. \"This is a concrete step in the drive to end the difference between homosexual and heterosexual couples,\" Bachelet said. The new law will take effect in six months. It will give legal weight to cohabiting relationships between two people of the same sex and between a man and a woman. The Chilean government estimates that around 2 million people will be able to benefit from the change. The law is intended to end discrimination faced by common-law couples, such as not being allowed to visit partners in hospital, make medical decisions on their behalf or decide what to do with their remains. It also gives the couples greater rights in the realms of property, health care, pensions and inheritance. A number of South American nations have moved to allow same-sex civil unions in recent years.

They will be sentenced June 26, according to Orange County, Florida, online court records. Until then, they'll be held in the county jail. Champion, 26, died in November 2011 after a band hazing ritual in which he was beaten aboard a school bus after a football game in Orlando, Florida.

A medical examiner ruled Champion's death a homicide and said he died within an hour of being beaten. Champion suffered multiple blunt trauma blows, the medical examiner said. A total of 15 defendants were charged originally, but most took plea deals, WFTV reported. Last October, Dante Martin stood trial and was convicted of the same charges.
