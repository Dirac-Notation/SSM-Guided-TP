[via Mother Jones] ||||| WASHINGTON -- Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry raised some eyebrows Friday night with a speech performance in Manchester, N.H., that was unusually expressive. \n \n A Huffington Post reporter was in the audience for the speech but did not have a chance to review video footage of the Texas governor's remarks until Saturday afternoon when a montage of moments in the speech surfaced on YouTube. \n \n The video below is not a full version of his remarks. It is a carefully edited montage designed to highlight the giddiest and strangest moments of a roughly 25-minute speech. The owner of the YouTube account, CharlieJohnson1986, did not respond to a message sent to the account. \n \n But while the video is designed to make Perry look bad, it does capture elements of his speech that were widely remarked upon in the crowd by those who saw the speech. \n \n \"It was different,\" Manchester Mayor Ted Gatsas told HuffPost after the speech. \n \n A Perry spokesman did not respond to an e-mail Friday night inquiring about Perry's manner, and initially declined to comment on Saturday. \n \n Update at 9:25 p.m.: \n \n \"The Governor is passionate about the issues he talks about,\" Perry spokesman Mark Miner said in an email to HuffPost on Saturday night. \n \n This article has been changed to remove a reference unrelated to the event.

At age 16, Ivins Rosier confessed to breaking into the home of Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Robert Boody in West Palm Beach and shooting the 5-year-old German Shepherd, the newspaper noted in May. Rosier's attorney argued that a detective \"hustled\" the boy during interrogation by equating the dog's death to the \"murder of a law enforcement officer\" (which wasn't legally true). Rosier's attorney also wanted his client sentenced as a juvenile with a maximum sentence of 6 years, CBS 12 reports. \"I believe this to be sadistic to do this to a child,\" said Rosier's attorney, who plans to appeal. He conceded that Rosier's crimes were serious, \"but when you look at the range of punishments available, that's why they call it juvenile.\" Ultimately, Rosier's sentence resulted from convictions on three felony counts: cruelty to animals with a firearm, burglary of a dwelling with a firearm, and shooting into a building. \"A gun in a 16-year-old's hand can do equally the damage as a gun in an adult's hand,\" said the prosecuting attorney. \"He's not a child.\" The trooper, Boody, cried when testifying about how he came home to find his dog crippled by gunshot wounds. (In Utah, a 16-year-old boy faces as many as 15 years in prison for taking part in a robbery with friends.)"}

The penny might be more trouble than it's worth. The cost to produce the one-cent coin increased to 1.5 cents during 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported. In 2015, the penny cost 1.43 cents to make, while in 2014, its production value was 1.66 cents. \n \n The president and Congress is constantly cutting funds to important programs to save money. Here\u2019s a easy way to cut the budget plus get rid of a coin no one really likes or needs. Our bases overseas do not use pennies. The lowest denomination is the nickel. The only pennies you see overseas are those brought over by new recruits. ||||| Pennies aren\u2019t cheap. \n \n The one-cent US coin, mostly made of zinc with a little bit of copper, is the most abundant coin in the country. Last year, the US Mint produced more than 8.4 billion pennies for circulation. Between production costs and shipping, they cost $0.0182 each, which totaled to $69 million (pdf, p. 9) in losses compared to their total value\u2014the biggest in nine years. This is likely due to the rising cost of zinc for use in heavy industry, construction, machine and ship building, and steel production. \n \n Nickels have cost more to make than their monetary value for over a decade. The five-cent coins\u201475% copper and 25% nickel\u2014cost about seven cents each to produce last year. Prices for copper have surgedIt\u2019s a key ingredient in any kind of circuit or wiring, and the rise of electric cars in particular has put stress on the market. Nickel has also gotten more expensive for its use in stainless steels. \n \n Fortunately, dimes and quarters are cheaper to make, costing less than their monetary value. So the Mint makes up the losses incurred on pennies and nickels with its 10- and 25-cent coins, and last year reported making $391.5 million in seigniorage.\nQ: Summarize the above article briefly in 6 sentences. [/INST]\nA: ", "summary_gt": "\u2013 It costs more than a penny to make a penny. The US Mint produced more than 8.4 billion of the one-cent coins last year, at a cost of $0.0182 each with production costs and shipping taken into account. That means $69 million was lost when compared to the pennies' total value, Quartz reports, the biggest loss in nine years. That's probably because zinc (pennies are made mostly of zinc, with a small amount of copper) has been rising in price. Nickels, which are worth five cents, cost seven cents each to make, but dimes and quarters cost less than their value to produce, which ends up making up for the losses associated with pennies and nickels. Even so, petitions abound on the internet to abolish the penny and nickel."}

That amounts to $1.7 million worth of silver, $6.5 million of copper\u2014and a whopping $43 million in gold, reports Quartz. Activist group Fairphone, which watches electronics supply chains, notes that a typical smartphone contains 30 milligrams of gold, mainly in circuit boards and other internal components, reports Business Insider. It's not a lot, but spread across millions of phones and other electronics, it adds up. CNNMoney reports that while it's pricey, gold is a popular choice in consumer electronics for being corrosion resistant yet excellent at conducting electricity. (Silver is a superior conductor but corrodes easily.) In March, Apple unveiled an experimental bot called Liam, which can disassemble an iPhone in 11 seconds and sort its parts for recycling. Prototypes are already at work, and the line is designed to take apart 1.2 million phones a year. \"It's an experiment in recycling technology, and we hope this kind of thinking will inspire others,\" Apple notes.

Turns out there's quite the saga behind it. It's all very intense. \n \n The video was first shared on the Facebook page of user Steven Stubenraugh, where it's since received 3.8 million views at the time of writing. \n \n The video shows a man running toward a kangaroo, which has a dog in a headlock. \n \n The man confronts the kangaroo, who then lets go of the dog after a struggle. Then out of nowhere, the dude gives the kangaroo a punch in the face. \n \n SEE ALSO: Dude creates what is possibly the most Australian Christmas tree ever \n \n There's been discussion over whether the footage is fake or not, and of course, over whether it's okay to punch an animal in the face in self defence. \n \n It turns out the footage was from a \"final\" wild pig-hunting trip for a young man named Kailem, who died from cancer last week, according to news.com.au. \n \n \"Basically Kailem wanted to catch a boar,\" trip-organiser Mathew Amor told the news outlet. \n \n \"And so a few of us got together to take him out, and another mate filmed more than an hour of video to put together as a DVD for Kailem and his family of the trip.\" \n \n The man who actually punched the kangaroo is only known as \"Goo,\" and has kept quiet due to having a \"good government job.\" \n \n However Daily Mail say they have identified the man as a zookeeper, working in the elephant enclosure at Taronga Western Plains Zoo \u2014 which, if true, would add yet another layer of strangeness to the whole story. \n \n By the way, the dog is fine thanks to its breastplate \u2014 used to protect it from boar tusks. \n \n \"My mate only stunned it,\" Amor said. \"His hand was OK, he didn't hit it very hard at all. It was funny because the guy who did it is the most placid bloke. We laughed at him for chucking such a sh*t punch.\" \n \n Yep, Australia is as wild as you think it is. ||||| Notice \n \n You must log in to continue.\nQ: Summarize the above article briefly in 10 sentences.

The video, which has amassed more than 4.1 million views so far, was first posted on Facebook Saturday by Steven Stubenrauch, who said he got it from a buddy from Down Under. But while the shot to the 'roo's face is indeed cringeworthy, Mashable explains there's a \"saga behind it,\" and it's \"very intense.\" The man in the video, IDed by News.com.au as Greig Tonkins\u2014nicknamed \"Goo,\" meaning this fight could be deemed \"Goo vs. 'Roo,\" as NineNews.com.au astutely notes\u2014was part of a hunting trip in June for a friend named Kailem, who was in bad shape from cancer and wanted desperately to go on a boar-hunting trip with friends. And so Mathew Amor invited Kailem and some other friends, including Tonkins (who it turns out is a zookeeper), to his New South Wales property for the hunt, and while they were gallivanting about, the featured kangaroo reached out, grabbed Tonkins' dog Max, and put the pup in a headlock. And so Tonkins jumped into action, throwing the punch now seen 'round the world. Everyone turned out to be fine: Amor says Max was startled but OK, the kangaroo was simply \"stunned,\" and Tonkins came away unscathed because he didn't throw that hard of a punch. \"It was funny because the guy who did it is the most placid bloke,\" Amor says. \"We laughed at him for chucking such a s--- punch.\" Sadly, Kailem died last week, but Amor says he'd \"be looking down from up there [heaven] and laughing because it was the highlight of the trip.\" (A cyclist says a kangaroo ruined her breast implants.)"}

Salon set out to find the 10 Trippiest Movies Ever Made, and Matt Zoller Seitz's collection has everything from Disney to David Lynch to Porky Pig. Samples: Porky in Wackyland (1938): Here's one part: \"In a field of towering mushrooms, Porky is menaced by a huge, fanged beast who suddenly starts traipsing about like a toddler, pealing, 'La la la! La la la!,\" writes Seitz. The Loony Tunes short is a true \u201cmind-effer.\u201d Fantasia (1940): Come on, dancing mushrooms? The psychedelic combo of instrumental music and choreographed animation\u2014both dramatically horrifying and playfully silly\u2014was probably pretty wicked for kids at the time. Yellow Submarine (1968): Another popular animation set to music, this movie follows the Fab Four on a journey to restore color to Pepperland\u2026and that\u2019s essentially all the plot you\u2019ll find. The rest is stunning visual imagery to accompany Beatles\u2019 classics like \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d and \u201cLucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\u201d Inland Empire (2006): This list wouldn\u2019t truly be trippy without infamous surreal director David Lynch. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968): Stanley Kubrick\u2019s sci-fi classic, \"a parable of evolution and the limits of imagination,\" plays with the mind\u2019s concept of space, time, and human existence. After 43 years, it still lives up to its original promo, \u201cThe ultimate trip.\u201d See the other trippy classics that made the list."}

This data is currently not publicly accessible. ||||| Most psychologists agree that a person's basic personality\u2014whether they are an introvert or extrovert, for example\u2014remains the same throughout life. What we might see as personality changes are actually just responses to external factors, such as getting a job, getting married or becoming a parent. That said, research does indicate that our personalities become more solidified, or stable, as we get older. \n \n That change is not linear, however. New research indicates that our personalities become increasingly stable as our 20s melt into our 30s, 40s and even 50s, but that that stability then often begins to taper off in old age, Research Digest reports. \n \n Researchers in New Zealand recruited 4,000 men and women aged 20 to 80 to complete a personality questionnaire twice, with a gap of two years in between. The survey measured a person's honesty-humility factor as well as five major personality traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience, Research Digest writes. They compared how people's scores varied between years, and analyzed how all of the participants personalities related to one another, depending on age. \n \n Most people's personalities were generally stable, they found, but the stability of those trait followed a bell curve over time, peaking at middle-age and then dropping again. For certain traits\u2014conscientiousness, openness to experience, and honesty-humility\u2014Research Digest writes, the oldest participants' personality stability matched those of the youngest. \n \n Other interesting finds included \"domain specific\" variations, or ones that seem to be linked to what a person is dealing with at a particular point in their life. People in their 30s, for example, showed high levels of neuroticism, but by the time they reached their 50s that had tapered off and had been replaced by conscientiousness, openness and honesty-humility.\nQ: Summarize the above article briefly in 8 sentences.

And these biological and social changes may be the reasons behind what researchers are calling less stable personalities at those life stages. In fact, according to a study of almost 4,000 New Zealanders between the ages of 20 and 80, the stability of one's personality increases through youth and into middle age and peaks in our 50s, before we slide back into less stable versions of ourselves, reports Research Digest. As the Smithsonian puts it, \"in some ways, our 80-year-old selves mirror our 20-year-old selves.\" Some traits peaked at different times; the most stable traits in one's 30s are extraversion and neuroticism, while in the late 40s and early 50s it is openness, honesty-humility, and conscientiousness. The only trait that showed \"gradually reduced stability\" throughout life was agreeableness; apparently we are simply less and less agreeable as we pack the years on. Still, one's most basic personality\u2014introvert vs. extrovert, for example\u2014tends to remain consistent throughout one's life, even if the stability of traits waxes and wanes, notes the Smithsonian.

Did Cindy know Caylee had vanished?\"Caylee was missing in my heart that day. She wasn't missing physically.

And it started to become more of a reality and less of a dream.\" \n \n Dinkmeyer likens what he does to day-trading on the stock market. \n \n \"What you're doing is you're trying to find a company that is trading for less than it's really worth. ... So if there's a company out there that's priced at $50 on a given day, and you think that company is really worth $60 or $70, you want to own that company and invest in that company, and that's the same thing daily fantasy players are doing. \n \n \"They're given a list of prices for all the individual players, and they have to figure out which ones are worth more than those actual prices to compile the best team that can put together the most points.\" \n \n Combined with his incomes as a writer for fantasy sports websites and a host on satellite radio, Dinkmeyer says he can live out this sports fantasy for the long haul. \n \n \"This is something that I imagine doing for the rest of my life.\"\nQ: Summarize the above article briefly in 8 sentences. [/INST]\nA: ", "summary_gt": "\u2013 His job is literally a fantasy: Drew Dinkmeyer makes his money by betting on fantasy games, and he's not exactly struggling. The 31-year-old quit his work as an investment analyst in June so he could concentrate on fantasy sports, and he's making comparable money. \"After a few years of playing, I started to have income levels that were commensurate with what I was making in the financial world,\" he tells NPR. But Dinkmeyer may not be playing what you're playing: He plays \"daily fantasy sports,\" where instead of being stuck with a team for a season, the action is compressed into a single night. So instead of laying down one bet per season, he makes daily bets. (The Wall Street Journal has a good rundown on how it works, and how \"advanced statistics\" play a part.) Being a \"daily fantasy\" player is like day-trading, Dinkmeyer says. \"What you're doing is you're trying to find a company that is trading for less than it's really worth.\" Fantasy players get a football-player price list, for instance, \"and they have to figure out which ones are worth more than those actual prices to compile the best team that can put together the most points.\" The Journal reports that of the 30 million fantasy players in America, experts believe no more than 100 earned at least $40,000 last year. NPR notes that Dinkmeyer pads his income by writing about fantasy sports online and hosting a satellite radio show, and has a wife who \"does very well in the financial industry.\""}

Although the numbers increased last year, so did the number of law enforcement agencies reporting hate crime data\u2014with approximately 1,000 additional agencies contributing information. The report, Hate Crime Statistics, 2017, includes hate crime information for last year, broken down by location, offenders, bias types, and victims. \n \n According to the report, the most common bias categories in single-bias incidents were race/ethnicity/ancestry (59.6) percent, religion (20.6 percent), and sexual orientation (15.8 percent). In addition to the 7,106 single-bias incidents reported last year, there were also 69 multiple-bias hate crimes reported. \n \n About 5,000 of the hate crimes reported were categorized as crimes against persons, such as intimidation or assault. About 3,000 were considered crimes against property, such as vandalism, robbery, or burglary. (Some hate crime incidents are classified as both crimes against persons and crimes against property.) \n \n The FBI is working with law enforcement partners across the country to encourage reporting of hate crime statistics. Next year, FBI personnel will provide training for law enforcement officers on how to identify bias-motivated incidents and report that data to the FBI\u2019s UCR Program. Additionally, the Department of Justice launched a new hate crimes webpage, which has information for law enforcement on reporting incidents. \n \n Reporting hate crime data to the UCR Program allows the public, researchers, community leaders, and local government to raise awareness of the issue and gain a more accurate picture of hate crimes. It also allows law enforcement agencies to develop data-focused strategies and preventative measures. \n \n Hate crimes are the highest investigative priority in the FBI\u2019s civil rights program.\nQ: Summarize the above article briefly in 6 sentences.

The report, released Tuesday, shows there was a nearly 23% increase in religion-based hate crimes, including a 37% spike in anti-Jewish hate crimes. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker says the report is a \"call to action,\" reports the AP.

(Apparently, it's enough of a difference to be noticeable to the naked eye: Last week, a reader wrote in to the Los Angeles Times complaining about a \"26% reduction in surface area.\") And, as Consumer Reports noted last year, the cardboard tubes are also increasing in diameter as the number of sheets per roll decreases. But the price is not falling: In 2012 and 2013, the unit price rose about 2% per year.

So, without being scientific, I think a double roll is pretty well equivalent to what a standard roll was perhaps a decade ago,\" a research analyst tells NPR. One not-as-obvious reason for the TP trend is that companies that make toilet paper also make products like paper towels and napkins. Though toilet paper is essential\u2014Americans are estimated to use an average of 46 sheets per day, and that's probably not set to change any time soon\u2014paper towel and napkin sales are falling. In particular, large companies, like offices and restaurants, are moving toward things like air dryers or, the analyst explains, rationing how many napkins they dole out to customers. But they'll never cut down on their TP orders in an attempt to ration that particular product, so orders will remain steady. (As for those hand dryers, you might not want to use them.)"}

In his new book, With Charity for All: Why Charities Are Failing and a Better Way to Give, Stern bemoans the state of charitable activity today, arguing that most of the nonprofit sector is financially inept at best, and downright unsavory at worst. \n \n \n \n Some charities obviously are fraudulent. Every now and then we read about them. When the salary of the CEO and money spent on phone banks dwarf the tiny percentage of revenues, if any, that go to the supposed beneficiaries of a charity, it's easy to call foul. But it's not always so easy to identify this type of non-charity. Getting charitable status from the IRS is a breeze, state oversight is weak to non-existent, and plenty of donors are swayed by words like \"veteran,\" \"children,\" \"hope,\" \"beneficial,\" \"cancer,\" and other key words. Investigating the financials of charities can be time-consuming, frustrating, and near impossible. \n \n \n \n Other charities, while more above-board about their financials and activities, probably should not be classified as charities. Two examples Stern explores are non-profit hospitals and college football bowl games. In terms of treating needy patients, non-profit hospitals as a whole are no more charitable, and in some cases less, than their for-profit competitors. Yet they enjoy a variety of tax benefits that give them a competitive advantage. With the bowl games, it's even harder to say that they are \"charities\" with the money they spend on golf outings, high salaries, travel, and entertainment. Similarly, Stern points the finger at opera companies, charities which exist primarily for the benefit of--their donors! ||||| Our Top Charities \n \n We recommend few charities by design, because we see ourselves as a finder of great giving opportunities rather than a charity evaluator. In other words, we're not seeking to classify large numbers of charities as \"good\" or \"bad\"; our mission is solely to identify, and thoroughly investigate, the best. Read about our charity selection process and where we currently recommend that donors give.\nQ: Summarize the above article briefly in 10 sentences. [/INST]\nA: ", "summary_gt": "\u2013 The fiscal cliff isn't the only looming financial deadline. Just a few days remain to give to charity in 2012, and Ken Stern would prefer you not make your decision \"hastily, based on poor information.\" Writing for the Washington Post, the former NPR exec and author of this upcoming book dispels five myths clouding the topic: It's not all about the poor: There are 1.1 million charities in America ... including Oregon's Renegade Roller Derby team, the All Colorado Beer Festival, and countless hospitals. Stern explains it's \"astonishingly easy\" to form a charity, with the IRS OKing 99.5% of applications from would-be charities. Low overhead is a sign of greatness: A number of charity raters favor those who put upward of 85% of their income toward services, with those using just a sliver of cash on expenses often seen as the best. But investing in things like research and training can make for stronger charities. To wit, Stern reminds us that the Red Cross' Hurricane Katrina and Sandy issues stemmed in part from inadequate investment \"in the infrastructure necessary to handle complex emergency relief.\" Picking a great charity to give to is easy: \"In fact, it is enormously difficult,\" writes Stern who, as example, points out that more than 60,000 charities have the word \"veteran\" in their names. His solution isn't the easiest: Work at it. \"On average, Americans spend more time watching television in one day than they do researching charities in an entire year.\" Put the time in, review studies published by GiveWell, and look beyond famous leaders or catchy stories.

The logo may be down a word, but the company says it won't otherwise look different: It will still use orange and pink and the rounded font it has had in use since 1973, with the pink part now becoming the apostrophe. And yes, stores will still serve doughnuts."}
